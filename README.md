# angular-northwind example

This is a simple project to demonstrate angular 6 with bootstrap, retrieving northwind data from an api service.

## How to run

This project requires an api service, download http://github.com/andymk/ravendb-northwind and get that running first.

Either open a command prompt or a terminal window in Visual Studio Code.
Run `npm install` to restore all the dependencies.
Run `npm start` to begin a server and open the app in a browser.
